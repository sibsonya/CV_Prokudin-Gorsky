3 practical tasks: reconstruction of Prokudin-Gorsky images, changing image's proportions (maintaining the content),  recognition of road signs using the SVM method.

# Prokudin-Gorsky
The first color photographer of Russia is Mikhail Sergeyevich Prokudin-Gorsky, who made the only color port of Leo Tolstoy. Each of his shots consists of three images in grayscale, corresponding to the blue, green and red color channels. Now
a collection of his photographs is in the American Library of Congress, a scan of the photographic plates available online. There is a program that combine images obtained from Prokudin-Gorsky photographic plates.
